# Teaching Rust to my wife

This aims to be a series of blog posts about my journey into teaching Rust to my wife.<br/>
My wife knows nothing about development, so it's the perfect test subject for a guide starting from zero.

## Why?

You're probably thinking "it surely already exists at least one guide to teach Rust from scratch!", and you're right, for example there is [Easy Rust](https://github.com/Dhghomon/easy_rust/), and surely there are more, all written by people better than me in many ways, better at Rust, better at exposing concepts, better at writing, etc...<br/>
But one day my wife come to me and asked me to teach her to program, she must have been drunk, in a self harming moment, or both, but considering she voluntarily married me, she probably always have been like that.<br/>
So, without any preparation, I started teaching her everything from scratch. You need to know, in her school days, more than 10 years ago, the IT class was about writing excel macros, so when I say "from scratch" I mean for real.<br/>
Despite me being far from the best teacher, results started coming, so, for me, it was a big, unexpected, success.

So here comes my friend [Zoten](https://github.com/zoten), who told me "why don't you write it down?"<br/>
I've never been good at exposing concepts, but I'm trying to improve myself, I just had my first public talk at RustLab 2022, so here I am, starting a new blog series, just to prove myself I can do it.
